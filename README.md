Kube-OVN, a [CNCF Sandbox Project](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/), integrates OVN-based Network Virtualization with Kubernetes. It provides enhanced support for KubeVirt and unique Multi-Tenancy capabilities.

## Network Topology

## Features

- **Non-Primary CNI Mode**: Kube-OVN can work as a secondary CNI alongside other primary CNIs (Cilium, Calico, etc.), providing additional network interfaces and advanced networking features via Network Attachment Definitions (NADs).
- **VPC Support**: Multi-tenant network with independent address spaces, where each tenant has its own network infrastructure such as eips, nat gateways, security groups and loadbalancers.
- **Namespaced Subnets**: Each Namespace can have a unique Subnet (backed by a Logical Switch). Pods within the Namespace will have IP addresses allocated from the Subnet. It's also possible for multiple Namespaces to share a Subnet.
- **Vlan/Underlay Support**: In addition to overlay network, Kube-OVN also supports underlay and vlan mode network for better performance and direct connectivity with physical network.
- **Static IP Addresses for Workloads**: Allocate random or static IP addresses to workloads.
- **Seamless VM LiveMigration**: Live migrate KubeVirt vm without network interruption.
- **Multi-Cluster Network**: Connect different Kubernetes/Openstack clusters into one L3 network.
- **TroubleShooting Tools**: Handy tools to diagnose, trace, monitor and dump container network traffic to help troubleshoot complicate network issues.
- **Prometheus & Grafana Integration**: Exposing network quality metrics like pod/node/service/dns connectivity/latency in Prometheus format.
- **ARM Support**: Kube-OVN can run on x86_64 and arm64 platforms.
- **Subnet Isolation**: Can configure a Subnet to deny any traffic from source IP addresses not within the same Subnet. Can whitelist specific IP addresses and IP ranges.
- **Network Policy**: Implementing networking.k8s.io/NetworkPolicy API by high performance ovn ACL.
- **DualStack IP Support**: Pod can run in IPv4-Only/IPv6-Only/DualStack mode.
- **Pod NAT and EIP**: Manage the pod external traffic and external ip like tradition VM.
- **IPAM for Multi NIC**: A cluster-wide IPAM for CNI plugins other than Kube-OVN, such as macvlan/vlan/host-device to take advantage of subnet and static ip allocation functions in Kube-OVN.
- **Dynamic QoS**: Configure Pod/Gateway Ingress/Egress traffic rate/priority/loss/latency on the fly.
- **Embedded Load Balancers**: Replace kube-proxy with the OVN embedded high performance distributed L2 Load Balancer.
- **Distributed Gateways**: Every Node can act as a Gateway to provide external network connectivity.
- **Namespaced Gateways**: Every Namespace can have a dedicated Gateway for Egress traffic.
- **Direct External Connectivity**: Pod IP can be exposed to external network directly.
- **BGP Support**: Pod/Subnet IP can be exposed to external by BGP router protocol.
- **Traffic Mirror**: Duplicated container network traffic for monitoring, diagnosing and replay.
- **Hardware Offload**: Boost network performance and save CPU resource by offloading OVS flow table to hardware.
